# Hello Markdown!

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Rememver the basic ayntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like `console.writelint("Hello Markdotn!");`

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
